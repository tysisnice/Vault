## Hey brother Floyd!

Here are some things for your attention regarding the SCE 414 at Sunbury

 - #### Codes
	 **0000** - *Kingdom Hall alarm code*
	 **3410** - *Kingdom Hall PC code*
	 **8apvwh6xzj** - *WiFi password*

- #### Screen Sharing
	There are a few options for screen sharing from your onstage devices onto the TV screens. We can set something up for you, such as **VLC remote**, but our AV brother would like to know what you have successfully used at other schools and if you'd prefer to continue using those methods. Also please let us know if you're using apple products as we may need to purchase software. 

- #### Stage Setup
	We will have a large enough table and whiteboard (1500 x 900) set up for you on stage. We have **2 regular wired mics**, **2 table mounted mics**, and **2 roving mics**. Let us know if we need anything more.

- #### Lapel Cards
	We are ready to print off some lapel cards for you. Do you have a file to send to us to print?
